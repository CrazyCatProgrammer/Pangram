Introduction
============
''Pangram'' is a simple python program to check whether or not a sentence has every letter of the alphabet.

Motivation
**********

Pursuit of learning! Also possible job. That tends to motivate me quite a lot.

Limitations
***********
Will not repeat if no sentence is given. This also needs more error checking and removal of special characters.
